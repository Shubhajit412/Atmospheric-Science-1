## Introduction

The main objective of this course is to determine the significance of studying atmospheric sciences in the regional and global contexts, prediction of weather and climate change, identification and remediation of environmental threats.

It also analyses recent trends and emerging frontiers.

### Earthâ€™s Atmosphere :

evolution of the Earth and its atmosphere - elements and compounds | spectrum of radiation of the sun and Earth | composition and structure of the atmosphere - pressure and wind systems | vertical structure of pressure, density, temperature, wind and moisture.

Sun Earth relationships - seasons, heat budget, latitudinal heat budget.

### Atmospheric Observations:

Overview of meteorological observations | measurement of temperature | humidity, pressure, wind and precipitation, high altitude observations | weather RADAR and satellites, vertical structure and composition of the atmosphere.

### About the codes :


The repository contains two main codes :
1. code to analyse temperature gradient distribution in the atmosphere relative to logitudinal and lattitudinal axes | plots generated are also committed | `language used : R`
2. code to create an e-poster, which serves as a tool to promote and uplift research ideas in community | topic selected is **'A SIMPLIFIED APPROACH TOWARDS SOME OF THE SCATTERINGS IN THE ATMOSPHERE'** | `language used : latex`
